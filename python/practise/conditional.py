# # A cinema hall charges ₹200 for adults and ₹150 for children. If the person’s age is below 12,
# # they are considered a child; otherwise, they are an adult.
# # Write a program to calculate the ticket price based on age.


# age = int(input("Enter Your age: "))
# noOfTickets = int(input("how many tickets do you want : "))
# price = 0
# if age < 12 :
#     price = 150 
# else :
#     price = 200

# ticket_price = price*noOfTickets

# print(ticket_price)




# An e-commerce site gives discounts:
#  If bill amount ≥ ₹5000 → 20% discount
#  If bill amount ≥ ₹3000 → 15% discount
#  If bill amount ≥ ₹1000 → 10% discount
#  Otherwise → No discount
# Write a program to calculate the final price after discount.
